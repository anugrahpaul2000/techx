           We are living in the world in which machines are becoming very important part of our daily survivals whether it is to run business or to live a normal life.
           And that machines are collecting a lot of data, i.e., we are right now with huge amount of data and that we can access for our benefits. We can do a lot with that data.
           So let's see what we can do: <blockquote>We are slowly moving into an era where data is the starting point and not the end -Pearl Zhu</blockquote>

           So be ready for that as you are going to drive in the path of data, you will get surrounded by data, you will be working with data.
           In simple terms you are going to see the life of Data Analyst. 
           
           So if you ready to take the responsibility we can start or you can leave this post and explore other domains on our websites.

              I am glad you still reading this and ready to take the responsibilty.
              <blockquote> So before starting give youself a Cheer!</blockquote>
              Ok, So let's understand what is <u>Data Analytics</u>. Data analytics, by hearing this term we get the clear idea that it is something related to data, now comes what the data is, it is basically an information which usually gets collected by our observation..
              
              Or we can say it is a set of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more person or things.

              Now what the Analytics is, to do the computational analysis, interpretation and communication of meaningful data in order to find different and useful solution.
              
              
            </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted" align="center">Image by Pixabay</span>
            
            <p align="justify">
              Now collaborating both the things we get the clear picture of what the Data Analytics is a set of quantitative and qualitative approaches for deriving valuable insights from data. It involves a lot of process that includes interpreting, categorizing and extracting data in order to derive various connections, relations and other valuable stuffs.
              
              
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Today almost every organizations has morphed itself into data driven organizations this means that are making their approach to collect more insightful data that is related to their business, markets and customer processes. This data is then stored, categorized, visualized and analysed to make sense out of it and make a valuable insight from it.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Data Analyst v/s Data Scientist</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              Always remember 
              <blockquote>“With Data Collection - "The Sooner , the better"  is always the best answer -Marissa Mayer ”</blockquote> 
              
              As industrialization grows, Data Scientist will more focus on business needs, machine learning and strategic oversights, while data analysts who works for business will more focus on creating models and other stuffs.

              In General, Data Analysts focus more on answering to specific questions, analyzing problems and come with the better solutions, whereas Data Scientists concentrate efforts on producing insights.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                In terms of technical skills, future Data Scientist will need to focus more on machine learning operation Process.

                Tools used for the Data Analysis are “Statistics and Data Modelling “and for the Data Science is “Hadoop, Programming Languages and Machine Learning “.

                Span of Domain is comparatively smaller in Data Analysis where as it is very expansive in Data Science.

              <ul>
              <li><b>Variable: </b> 
                It is a characteristics of any entity being studied that is capable of taking on different values.
              </li><br>
              <li><b>Measurements: </b> 
                It is when a standard process is used to assign numbers to particular attributes or characteristics of variable.
              </li><br>
              <li><b>Data: </b> Data are recorded measurements.  
              </li>
              So, suppose there is a variable you measure the phenomena, after measuring the phenomena, you are substituting some value for the variable. so the variable will take a particular value and that value is nothing but Data.
