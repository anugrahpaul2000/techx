           Till Now we are pretty much aware of the fact about the Data Analytics, So in this article we will see some facts about R programming language, i.e., 
           Some basic about how it works and all.
           Remember that: <blockquote>Learning from data is virtually universally useful. Master it and you will be welcomed anywhere - Todd Papaioannou
            , CTO at Splun</blockquote>

           <br><br>
           Before going into the R, Let's first see what is the role of Internet of things in Data Science.
          </p>
          
              
              <p align="justify"> 
                <b>Internet of things (IOT):  </b>
                <ul>
                <li>Information from anywhere or anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessible, query-able and organised.

                  Uncover inter connections and patterns that were not possible to drive before.
                </li> 
              </ul>
              </p>

              
              <p align="justify"> 
                <b>Data Science: </b>
                <ul>
                <li> It provided an algorithms for deriving useful information about state of the equipment and about the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All algorithms for all kinds of problems.

                  	Self Learning.
              </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              
              <h2 class="section-heading">Getting Started with R</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                It is an open source programming language uysed for statistical computing and for analysis of various types of data in different ways. It is a GNU project which is quite similar to S language and environment which as developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and Colleagues.

            </p>
            <p>
              It provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, classification, clustering, etc.) and many graphical techniques.
            </p>
             <p>
               It is available as Free Software under the terms of <b>Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License</b> in source code form. It compiles and run on a wide variety of platform such as Windows, MacOS and Linux.
             </p>


             <h2 class="section-heading">The R Environment</h2>

             <p align="justify">
              R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, claculation and graphical display. It mainly includes:
            <ul>
              <li>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,</li>
              <li>a suite of operators for calculation on arrays, in particular matrices,</li>
              <li>an effective data handling and storage facility,</li>
              <li>graphical facilities for data analysis and</li>
              <li>a well developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursoive functions and input and output facilities.</li>
            </ul> 
            
            </p>
              <p align="justify"> 
                The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
              </p>
              <p align="justify"> 
                R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it as an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a conclusion, R is world’s most widely used statistics programming language. It's the # 1 choice of data scientists and supported by a vibrant and talented community of contributors.
              </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Local Environment Setup</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              If you are still willing to set up your environment for R, you can follow the steps given below.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Windows Installation</b>
            </p>
            <p>You can download the Windows installer version of R from R-3.2.2 for Windows (32/64 bit) <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Download R Studio</a> and save it in a local directory.</p>
            <p>
              As it is a Windows installer (.exe) with a name "R-version-win.exe". You can just double click and run the installer accepting the default settings. If your Windows is 32-bit version, it installs the 32-bit version. But if your windows is 64-bit, then it installs both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
            </p>  
            <p>
              After installation you can locate the icon to run the Program in a directory structure "R\R3.2.2\bin\i386\Rgui.exe" under the Windows Program Files. Clicking this icon brings up the R-GUI which is the R console to do R Programming.
            </p>

              </center>
              
              <p align="justify">  
                So, till now I hope that you all got the clear idea about R programming language and getting excited to learn how to use the same, how to work in R Environment.

              </p>

              <p>Remember: 
                <blockquote>Collecting data does not mean discovering
                  <ul>
                    <li>Data should lead to value proposition.</li>
                    <li>The Science (and art) of converting "Collected Data" to useful knowledge is called Data Science.</li>
                  </ul>
                </blockquote>
              </p>

                Guys, Stay connected with us in the next article we are going to drive in more depth and will start the practical analysis with R. Wish you all the very best !
